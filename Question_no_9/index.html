Inline CSS

    Inline CSS is used to style a single HTML element.


    To add inline CSS, add the style attribute to the relevant element.


    p style="color: red;"&gt;This is a paragraph </p>

    In the above example, the style attribute is used to add CSS to the paragraph element.

    Internal CSS is used to style a single HTML page.

    To add internal CSS, add the style tag in the head section of the HTML document. The style tag can contain any
    CSS property.


                p {
                    color: red;
                }

    External CSS is used to style multiple HTML pages.

    To add external CSS, create a new file with .css extension and add all the CSS rules in that file. Then link
    that file to the HTML document using the link tag.

link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css"&gt;
